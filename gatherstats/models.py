    Statistics from the IAR stats endpoint look like the following:

    .. code:: js

        {
            "asset_counts": {
                "all": {
                    "total": 1234,
                    "completed": 1234,

                        "total": 123,

                }
            }
        }

    In order to allow this schema to change in the future, we convert this structured table into a
    series of rows recording the JavaScript-style key path and the value. For example, one row from
    the above would be created as::

        from django.utils import timezone
        from gatherstats.models import Stat

        Statistic(
            endpoint='http://iar-backend.invalid/stats',

            numeric_value=123,
            fetched_at=now(),
        )

    Sufficiently clever SQL can be used to query various things from this DB. For example, to get a
    list of all institutions with available statistics:

    .. code:: sql

        SELECT DISTINCT
            SUBSTRING(key FROM '^by_institution\.([^\.]+)\.[^\.]+$') AS institution
        FROM
            gatherstats_statistic
        WHERE key ~ '^by_institution\.([^\.]+)\.[^\.]+$'
        ORDER BY
            institution;
